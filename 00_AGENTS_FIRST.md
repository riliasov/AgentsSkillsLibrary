# Onboarding (Agents First)

Welcome! If you are reading this, the **Global Skills Library** is active in this project. This is your primary resource for maintaining engineering standards.

## 🚀 Initial Steps
1. **Explore the Index**: Read [01_INDEX.md](file:///Users/rambook/Developer/AgentsSkillsLibrary/01_INDEX.md) to understand available tools.
2. **Review Safety Rules**: Read [02_SAFE_AND_PERMISSIONS.md](file:///Users/rambook/Developer/AgentsSkillsLibrary/02_SAFE_AND_PERMISSIONS.md) before executing commands.
3. **Adopt a Role**: Choose a specialist agent from the root directory based on the task (bug, feature, refactor).
4. **Choose a Style**: Unless specified otherwise, use `command-architect.md` for planning or `command-rapid.md` for simple fixes.

## 📌 Key Guidelines
- **Always Analyze**: Consult `skill-project-analysis.md` when entering a new codebase.
- **Git Perfection**: Use `skill-git-workflow.md` for all commits.
- **Clean Code**: Propose refactoring based on `agent-refactorer.md` if tech debt is spotted.
- **DB Expertise**: Consult `skill-postgresql.md` for any database-related work.
